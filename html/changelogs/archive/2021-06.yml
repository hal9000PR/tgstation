  - imageadd: Better greyscale support has been added to datum materials allowing
      objects to have more complex compositions of sprites. The golden cleric mace
      is extra shiny now.
  - bugfix: Mime shoes no longer runtime when generating their icon. This may fix
      some graphical oddity or do nothing at all since they get colored pure white
      anyway.
